Project Overview:

Created a simulated financial trading system that focuses on low-latency order processing.
The goal is to handle buy and sell orders quickly and efficiently.


Key Components:
a. Lock-Free Queue: Used for fast, thread-safe order submission.
                    Allows multiple threads to add and remove orders without blocking each other.

b. Order Book: Keeps track of all buy and sell orders.
               Uses sorted vectors for quick insertion and matching of orders.

c. Trading System: Manages the overall flow of orders and trades.
                   Uses a separate thread for processing orders to improve responsiveness.


Latency Optimization Techniques:
a. Lock-Free Data Structures: The queue uses atomic operations instead of locks, reducing contention and improving throughput.

b. Efficient Data Structures: Sorted vectors in the Order Book allow for fast binary search when inserting new orders.

c. Multithreading: Separate threads for order submission and processing allow for parallel execution.

d. Minimal Copying: Use of move semantics and shared pointers reduces unnecessary data copying.


How It Works: 
Orders are submitted to the lock-free queue.
A processing thread continuously takes orders from the queue and adds them to the order book.
The order book attempts to match buy and sell orders immediately.
When a match is found, a trade is executed and the orders are removed from the book.


Benefits: 
Low latency: Orders can be submitted and processed quickly.
High throughput: The system can handle many orders simultaneously.
Scalability: The design allows for easy expansion to handle more order types or matching algorithms.


Potential Improvements:

Implement more sophisticated matching algorithms.
Add support for different order types (e.g., limit orders, stop orders).
Implement a more realistic price discovery mechanism.

Advanced C++ features (templates, atomics, move semantics)
Concurrent programming techniques
Data structure optimization for performance
